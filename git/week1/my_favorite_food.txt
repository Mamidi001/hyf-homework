Soak 300g basmati rice in warm water, then wash in cold until the water runs clear.

STEP 2
Heat 25g butter in a saucepan and cook 1 finely sliced large onion with 1 bay leaf, 3 cardamom pods and 1 small cinnamon stick for 10 mins.

STEP 3
Sprinkle in 1 tsp turmeric, then add 4 chicken breasts, cut into large chunks, and 4 tbsp curry paste. Cook until aromatic.

STEP 4
Stir the rice into the pan with 85g raisins, then pour over 850ml chicken stock.

STEP 5
Place a tight-fitting lid on the pan and bring to a hard boil, then lower the heat to a minimum and cook the rice for another 5 mins.

STEP 6
Turn off the heat and leave for 10 mins. Stir well, mixing through 15g chopped coriander. To serve, scatter over the leaves of the remaining 15g coriander and 2 tbsp toasted almonds.

I've made this recipe a few times now and always get brilliant results. I sub the chicken and stock for vegan alternatives, some times add extra veg such as pepper or green beans and make my own paste out of tomato puree, water and curry powder (usually a korma blend). I find the instructions easy‚Ä¶
